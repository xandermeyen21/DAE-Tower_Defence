Tower Defence game for the course GamePlayScripting

Waves of enemies come towards your tower. The tower spawns in the middle of your screen. At the end of every wave you can choose for Attack speed, Range or damage upgrade. 
With the wrong choices, the chance comes that your tower will be elimanted. That's how you lose the game. The purpose is to survive as long as possible.

Newest version has new type of enemies. It shows the tower health. Every 5 waves a boss does spawn.

Goodluck and Have fun!
